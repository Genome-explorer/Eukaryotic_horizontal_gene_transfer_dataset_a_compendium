##### This script creates 3 directories (folders) to store your full gene fasta files, Coding sequence fasta files, and protein sequence fasta files
#### 1_make_new_directories.py
### To run this file make sure you have python installed
python 1_make_new_directories.py

##### This script adds full gene at the end of each of the fasta files in the full gene directory
#### 2_add_full_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### To run this file make sure the file is executable
chmod +x 2_add_full_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Next run the file
./2_add_full_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Then provide the path to full gene directory (folder), Example (Ex): /home/name/full_gene


##### This script adds CDS at the end of each of the fasta files in the full gene directory
#### 3_add_CDS_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### To run 3_add_CDS_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
chmod +x 3_add_CDS_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Next run the file
./3_add_CDS_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Then provide the path to Coding sequence directory (folder), Example (Ex): /home/name/CDSS


##### This script adds protein at the end of each of the fasta files in the proteins directory
#### 4_add_protein_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### To run 4_add_protein_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
chmod +x 4_add_protein_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Next run the file
./4_add_protein_gene_at_the_end_of_each_fasta_file.sh
### Then provide the path to protein directory (folder), Example (Ex): /home/name/proteins

#### Combing all full gene fasta files into one file full_gene.fasta
### To run 5_combine_all_full_gene_fasta_files_to_full_gene_fasta.py
python3 5_combine_all_full_gene_fasta_files_to_full_gene_fasta.py
### Next paste the full path to the full gene directory (folder)


#### Combing all coding sequence fasta files into one file CDS_gene.fasta
### To run 6_combine_all_CDS_fasta_files_to_CDS_gene_fasta.py
python3 6_combine_all_CDS_fasta_files_to_CDS_gene_fasta.py
### Next paste the full path to the Coding sequence directory (folder)
